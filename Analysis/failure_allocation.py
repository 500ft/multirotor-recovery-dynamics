"""Motor-level control allocation under propulsion failures (Study A, DR-SS-01).

The mixer model in ``sim_release_recovery`` bounds roll/pitch torque by a scalar
capability formula that assumes all four motors are healthy. This module replaces
that scalar with the actual actuator map so *failure classes* become representable:
each motor's thrust is a decision variable in ``[0, cap]``, failed motors are forced
to zero, and the partial-authority class caps every motor below its healthy limit.

Geometry (X configuration, top view, body axes x forward / y left):

    m2 (-a, +a, CW)      m1 (+a, +a, CCW)
    m3 (-a, -a, CCW)     m4 (+a, -a, CW)

with ``a = arm / sqrt(2)``. The wrench map is ``w = B f`` with
``w = (T, tau_x, tau_y, tau_z)``:

    T     = f1 + f2 + f3 + f4
    tau_x = a (f1 + f2 - f3 - f4)
    tau_y = a (-f1 + f2 + f3 - f4)
    tau_z = kappa (f1 - f2 + f3 - f4)

``kappa`` (drag-torque per unit thrust) is derived from the same yaw-torque bound the
mixer model uses: full differential thrust on one spin pair produces the placeholder
yaw limit, so ``kappa = yaw_torque_n_m / (2 f_max)``.

Allocation is REDUCED-ATTITUDE by design: the commanded wrench is ``(T, tau_x,
tau_y)`` only. After the loss of a rotor the drag-torque budget cannot balance yaw
(the vehicle spins about body z — the established rotor-out flight regime), so
spending clipped motor authority on a hopeless yaw command would misallocate the
little control that remains. The achieved yaw torque (including the spin-direction
imbalance that drives the post-failure spin) is still computed and fed to the
dynamics, so the spin and its gyroscopic coupling are simulated, not ignored.

Allocation is trim-anchored with direction-preserving desaturation (collective on
the zero-torque trim direction; torque increment solved at invariant collective and
scaled — never bent — into the per-motor box). The first committed version used a
single-pass pseudo-inverse + clip, which distorts both the torque axis and the
collective under saturation; the revision and its effect on Study A results are
recorded in ``docs/specs/survivable-set/design-a2.md``.

Analytic anchors reproduced exactly by the map (tested in
``tests/test_failure_allocation.py``):

* one rotor out (m4): zero roll/pitch torque forces ``f2 = 0, f1 = f3`` — flight on
  the remaining diagonal pair, balanced collective ceiling ``2 f_max``, unbalanced
  yaw (spin).
* two opposite out (m2, m4): torque available only about the diagonal joining the
  survivors; spin, collective ceiling ``2 f_max``.
* two adjacent out (m3, m4): both survivors on one side — roll trim is impossible
  at any positive thrust. No hover exists; the class is expected to depend on the
  descent-device actions.
