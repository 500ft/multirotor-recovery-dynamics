# Traceability index

One row per consequential decision: what it is, what requires it, where its
reasoning lives, which canonical inputs it depends on, how it will be validated,
and its current status. **The mathematics is not repeated here** — follow the link.

**Status vocabulary.** `derived` (reasoning recorded) · `asserted` (purpose
stated, derivation absent) · `bare` (value only) · `preregistered` (frozen before
execution) · `blocked` (needs an input that does not exist) · `unresolved`.
**No row is `measured` — no accepted physical measurement exists in this
repository.**

## How to use this

- Adding a consequential number? Add a row, and put the reasoning **beside the
  decision**, not here.
- Moving a status to `measured` requires recorded physical evidence under
  `evidence/`, not a calculation and not a citation.
- `blocked` rows name the open question that blocks them. Resolve the question,
  not the row.
