# Novelty assessment and open gaps

The repository's research question is preregistered in
`docs/specs/survivable-set/design.md` §1. This file records what the literature
shows is already established (so we never claim it), what is genuinely open, and
who else is publishing an adjacent claim.

## 1. Established — never claim as novel

| # | Established result | Anchor | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A quadrotor hovers and is position-controlled after **one rotor loss** by sacrificing yaw | Freddi/Lanzon/Longhi (2011, 2014); Mueller & D'Andrea (2014) | A, flight |
| 2 | The **relaxed-hover / primary-axis spinning** mechanism itself | Mueller & D'Andrea (2014, 2016) — **and patented, US 9,856,016 B2 + continuations** | A + IP |
| 3 | **Two-opposite** rotor loss, flight-validated at >8 m/s under wind | Sun, Wang, Chu & de Visser (T-RO 2021) | A, flight |
| 4 | **Two-adjacent and three-rotor** loss — solved analytically/in sim, and in **outdoor flight** with a single non-switching passive controller requiring no fault information | Mueller & D'Andrea (2016); **Ke, Cai & Quan (T-RO 2023)** | A, outdoor flight |
| 5 | **Recovery from arbitrary tumbling attitude/rate** after a rotor loss, including the allocator constraint that makes it work | **Sun, Baert, Strack van Schijndel & de Visser (ICRA 2020)** | A/B, MC + flight |
| 6 | Onboard-only operation through the post-failure spin (vision-based estimation; NMPC with per-rotor constraints) | Sun et al. (RA-L 2021); Nan et al. (RA-L 2022) | A/B, flight |
| 7 | **Fast detection exists**: 0.18 s identification with 0.60 m height loss | Tzoumanikas et al. (ICRA 2020) — *hexacopter, a floor not a quad number* | A/B |
| 8 | Controllability under **partial degradation** is solved theory: classical LTI controllability is insufficient under positive/bounded inputs | Du, Quan, Yang & Cai (JGCD 2015) | C |
| 9 | A **two-action switching threshold** between adaptive compensation and full FTC, derived experimentally | **Mao, Yeom, Nair & Loianno (RA-L 2024)** | B |
| 10 | Learned passive FTC spanning fault-free → partial → complete single-rotor failure without switching | Chen et al. (IROS 2025) | modality unverified |
| 11 | **Redistributed pseudo-inverse** allocation — our method, 30 years old, and known-suboptimal | Virnig & Bodden (1994); Härkegård (2002) | A/B |
| 12 | **Attitude-priority desaturation** (roll/pitch → collective → yaw) | Faessler et al. (RA-L 2017); PX4 airmode | A / deployed |
| 13 | **Monte-Carlo estimation of a quadrotor safe flight envelope**, substituting for HJ reachability | **Sun & de Visser (AIAA 2019)** | B |
| 14 | Parachute recovery of small UAS **at ≥900 g**, with a 10–15 m altitude floor | ASTM F3322; EASA M2 MoC; Siotia et al. (2026); ParaZero test data | A / B / C |

## 2. Genuinely open — the defensible lane

The literature is overwhelmingly about **one action**: here is a controller, it
stabilises the damaged vehicle. Recovery as a **choice among qualitatively
different actions, indexed by post-failure state**, is close to unoccupied.

1. **Action selection over (h, v_z, tumble rate, detection delay).** Mao et al.
   (2024) do two actions on one axis (damage severity). Nothing maps the
   height / vertical-speed / tumble-rate / detection-delay space to a *choice*.
2. **Height and vertical speed as decision variables.** The FTC literature
   reports height loss as an *outcome* (0.60 m), never as an *input that changes
   which action is correct*. The only altitude-indexed numbers found come from
   the parachute literature, which does not talk to the FTC literature.
3. **The recoverable set as a function of detection delay.** Everyone reports how
   fast they detect; nobody publishes "at 0.3 s delay and 4 m height, thrust
   reallocation cannot succeed for failure class X." **This is the natural core
   of our contribution.**
4. **The abort boundary.** Sun et al. (2020) recover from arbitrary attitude at
   generous altitude; nobody characterises where the **vertical budget** runs out
   first.
5. **Sub-250 g complete rotor loss: search-bounded, not empty** (amended
   2026-09-24). We found no published demonstration of recovery from *complete*
   rotor loss below 250 g — but a dedicated verified pass was not completed, so
   this is an open question rather than a confirmed gap. **Partial degradation at
   this scale is NOT open**: Çintaş & Özyer (2026) demonstrate it in real flight
   on a 30.6 g Crazyflie. The earlier claim that the spin/sensing failure mode
   "worsens as the vehicle shrinks" is **withdrawn** — terminal spin is
   independent of `Izz` (note 01 §6), so that scaling does not follow.
6. **Per-cell probability with exact bounds against a preregistered criterion.**
   The nearest work labels states binary safe/unsafe (Sun & de Visser 2019) or
   attaches probabilities on a fixed-wing, non-failure envelope (Yin et al. 2019).

### Scope correction, 2026-09-24 (critique C01)

The open lane above is stated in terms of a **policy over actions**. Our own
study does not yet deliver one: its `mechanism` and `realloc_only` cases differ in
installed hardware, so it compares **design packages**, not actions a single
aircraft could choose between in flight (`design.md` §6b). The novelty wording
below therefore describes work that is **specified but not yet performed**, and
must not be cited as a result of the current sweep. A runtime-policy claim
requires one fixed configuration with `A(c)` executable on it.

### The wording that survives

> We are not aware of published work that estimates, **per post-failure state
> cell**, P(survivable landing) with **exact binomial bounds** against a
> **preregistered** survivability criterion, and uses it to select among distinct
> recovery *actions*. The closest prior work is Sun & de Visser (2019)
> (Monte-Carlo quadrotor safe envelope; binary labels, nominal conditions), Yin
> et al. (2019) (probabilistic envelope, fixed-wing, not failure-conditioned),
> and Sun et al. (2020) (post-rotor-failure recovery validated by Monte Carlo,
> no set estimate with boundary uncertainty).

Checkable, and it survives a reviewer finding one more paper.

## 3. Contested gap — cite, don't collide

**Siotia, Shankar, Nair & Nair (2026)**, *Enhancing UAV survivability through
real-time stall detection and parachute assisted recovery*, Scientific Reports
16:18189, [10.1038/s41598-026-47045-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-026-47045-0).

Their published abstract asserts the field lacks "an integrated framework that
explicitly detects unrecoverable loss-of-control states and dynamically
transitions between active stabilization and passive descent using
**altitude-aware decision logic**." That is adjacent to — arguably overlapping —
our positioning.

**How we differ, and it must be stated this sharply:**

| | Siotia et al. (2026) | This repo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger | stall detection → deployment **threshold** | ranking over a gridded post-failure state (a *policy* is the stated goal, **not yet delivered** — see Status row) |
| State | altitude | (h, v_z, tumble rate, **detection delay**) × failure class |
| Status | published result | **package comparison performed; runtime policy specified but NOT performed** (§ scope correction) |
| Actions | stabilise **or** deploy | reallocation / mechanism / descent device — compared as **whole aircraft configurations**, not as choices one aircraft can make |
| Output | a decision rule | **P(survivable landing) per cell with exact bounds** |
| Failure mode | stall / loss of control, unspecified cause | **specified propulsion-failure classes** |
| Validation | HIL + simulation, 2 kg, no free-flight drops | simulation on EST inputs, sub-250 g, preregistered |

Our differentiator is **not** "altitude-aware". It is *a survivability estimate
per failure class over a post-failure state grid that includes detection delay,
with preregistered criteria and exact interval arithmetic.*

## 4. Gaps in the literature we could fill cheaply

These are real absences, verified, and within reach of this project:

1. **No dimensional prescription for weighting force against moment residuals in
   multirotor allocation.** Normalising to reference scales and reporting the
   effect would be a small, citable contribution (note 02 §3).
2. **~~No detection-latency distribution.~~ WITHDRAWN 2026-09-24 (critique C02).**
   Strack van Schijndel et al. (2021) report 95 % bounds of **[28, 132] ms** with
   box plots over 26 real propeller ejections. What remains open is narrower:
   delay as a function of the *failure condition* (rotor index, thrust level,
   degraded vs sudden-total loss) — their fault is idealised as "sudden and
   total". Our use of delay as a **state coordinate of the recovery problem** is
   a different construct from a detector's achieved latency, and should be
   described that way rather than as a gap in the literature.
3. **No quantitative recirculation correction for a small restrained multirotor
   bench test** — NASA Ames explicitly leaves it unquantified. A height/wall
   sweep at fixed commanded RPM would close it (note 06 §4).
4. **No crashworthiness / survivable-landing drop standard for small
   multirotors.** NIST's sUAS methods cover proficiency, not survivability; ASTM
   F3389/F3322 test the human side. ASSURE A4 flags the adjacent gap ("blade
   guard standards exist for consumer grade fans but not for flight worthy
   stands"). A 27.725-structured drop test on our own vehicle is a
   one-afternoon experiment that converts our criterion from assumed to measured.
5. **No canopy-sizing or inflation study for sub-250 g parachutes** — and a mass
   budget argument suggests there may be no viable product to study.

## 5. What this means for the research plan

- **Study A/B keeps its question** but must narrow its novelty wording (§2) and
  add the related-work anchors (§1 rows 5, 9, 13).
- **Study A2's "spin-locked controller" is adoption, not invention** — cite
  Mueller & D'Andrea and the patent.
- **Study C's drop test becomes the single highest-value experiment in the
  portfolio**, because it converts the landing criterion (gap 4) from an analogy
  into a measurement — and no one else has published one.
- **The paired-comparison fix (note 05 §3) is a correctness prerequisite** for
  any future claim about mechanism vs reallocation.
